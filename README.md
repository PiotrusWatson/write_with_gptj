# write_with_gptj
A quick n dirty hack remake of https://transformer.huggingface.co/ but using GPT-J in the back! instead of old gpt2s

Using https://github.com/vicgalle/gpt-j-api to make gpt-j happen.

Requires:
Python 3 (with pip)
npm

And a whole host of random crap that should be contained within the respective requirements.txts
